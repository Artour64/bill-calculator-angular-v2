# BillTipAndSplitCalculator

A calculator for a restaurant bill and tip, with a split option  
Made with Angular  
This is an improved and refactored version of [this](https://github.com/Artour64/bill-calculator-angular) repository.  
Additional time taken on improvements and refactoring: 41 minutes  
The most important change is that all the business logic was moved into an Angular service.  
Miscellaneous improvements include some formatting for readability, removing of unnecessary code, and other minor improvements like rounding decimals to two places.  
Testing was done by using the product and checking that the displayed results are the same as expected.  
Perhaps some unit tests could be made for the service with the business logic, more specifically that the properties are calculated correctly.  
For comparison, [here](https://github.com/Artour64/bill-calculator-vanilla) is the same project using only HTML and JavaScript, no libraries or frameworks.
